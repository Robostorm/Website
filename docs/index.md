# Robostorm Robotics
---

**Robostorm Robotics** is a part of Hunterdon County 4-H in New Jersey. We are the first non-agricultural club in the county, focusing on robotics and technology. We were founded in 2011 with only five members, and have since grown to accommodate more than twenty. We work on many projects, including our [Aquabot](projects/aquabot.md), [3D Printing](projects/3dprinter.md), and [more](projects/other.md).
