## About Us

We are Robostorm FTC team 12601. This is our third year as an FTC team. Our team is based out of Hunterdon County, New Jersey. The team is made up of students in the 8th grade to 11th grade from various school districts in the county. We meet several times each week to build, code and have fun with our robot and other projects. We also participate in a variety of outreach projects that benefit the community. Our team has an extensive list of contacts in the STEM community that we actively use to learn about STEM. 

We have advanced to the NJ State Championships each year we have competed and to the World Championships in Detroit, Michigan one time so far. The state competition is later in March and we hope to advance to the World Championships once again. 

Sadly, the 2019 - 2020 NJ State Championship and the April World Championships for FTC were cancelled because of the current global pandemic. Initially the NJ State Championships were postponed but as time moves on, the event organizers realized that there was not going to be a safe solution to running the event and it was cancelled for the year. 

Various team members have been hard at work on ideas for the 2020 - 2021 robot! 

As a club, we have been donating club supplies and printer time to help local hospitals, first responders and others deal with PPE shortages. Our members have donated several hundred face shields and other PPE items. In addition we helped one local police department obtain hand sanitizer and parts for a boot washing machine. We will continue to look for ways to utilize our technology skills to help out others.
