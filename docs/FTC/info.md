## About Us

We are Robostorm FTC team 12601. This is our second year as an FTC team. Last year, our rookie year, we were able to advance to the state championship from the RoboJoust Qualifier, then to the East Super Regional Championships in Scranton PA, and finally to the FIRST World Championships in Detroit Michigan.

This year we have made it to the state championship so far and we hope to get to the FIRST World Championship in April.
