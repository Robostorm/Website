## About Us

We are Robostorm FTC team 12601. This is our third year as an FTC team. Our team is based out of Hunterdon County, New Jersey. The team is made up of students in the 8th grade to 11th grade from various school districts in the county. We meet several times each week to build, code and have fun with our robot and other projects. We also participate in a variety of outreach projects that benefit the community. Our team has an extensive list of contacts in the STEM community that we actively use to learn about STEM. 

We have advanced to the NJ State Championships each year we have competed and to the World Championships in Detroit, Michigan one time so far. The state competition is later in March and we hope to advance to the World Championships once again.
