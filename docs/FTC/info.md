## About Us

We are Robostorm FTC team 12601. This is our sixth year as an FTC team. Our team is based out of Hunterdon County, New Jersey. The team is made up of students from 9th grade to 12th grade from various school districts in the county. We meet several times each week to build, code, and have fun with our robot and other projects. We also participate in a variety of outreach projects that benefit the community. Our team has an extensive list of contacts in the STEM community that we actively use to learn about STEM. 

We have advanced to the NJ State Championships each year we have competed and to the World Championships in Detroit, Michigan one time so far.  We hope to advance to the World Championships once again this year.

Most of the 2020 - 2021 season was forced to be remote due to the ongoing pandemic. Our robot performed well during the remote meets and we qualified for the NJ State Championships once again. NJ FTC delayed the championships several times in hopes of being able to hold them in person. After several delays, we were able to participate in-person at the NJ State Championships. Our robot performed well, we won several matches and were ranked highly early on in the tournament. Unfortunately some mechanical issues prevented us from maintaining the high ranking. We had a good judging day and took 3rd place in the Connect Award catagory. Overall, it was a great ending to a challenging year.  

As a club, we have been donating club supplies and printer time to help local hospitals, first responders and others deal with PPE shortages. Our members have donated several hundred face shields and other PPE items. In addition, we helped one local police department obtain hand sanitizer and parts for a boot washing machine. We will continue to look for ways to utilize our technical skills to help out others.
