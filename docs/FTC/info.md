## About Us

We are Robostorm FTC team 12601. This is our seventh year as an FTC team. Our team is based out of Hunterdon County, New Jersey. The team is made up of students from 8th grade to 12th grade from various school districts in the county. We meet several times each week to build, code, and have fun with our robot and other projects. We also participate in a variety of outreach projects that benefit the community. Our team has an extensive list of contacts in the STEM community that we actively use to learn about STEM. 

We have advanced to the NJ State Championships each year we have competed and to the World Championships in Detroit, Michigan one time so far.  We hope to advance to the World Championships once again this year. 

Our team has been active in off season outreach and teaching events this summer. We taught a class on mechanical design and design iterations during a training event at Kean University. During the kickoff event at Livingston High School, our club presented 3D printing, CAD, and CNC printing topics for the participating teams. We also led a seminar about having a competitive team. We also hosted a showcase event for FIRST, FTC, and local FRC teams at the Hunterdon County 4H fair. During the fair we held daily events in our tent, reaching thousands of visitors while sharing the ideals of FIRST.
