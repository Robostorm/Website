## Zach
I am 14 years old and attend J.P. Case Middle School in Flemington New Jersey.  I’ve been in robotics clubs for 5 years and this is my first year on the team.  While I like sports like soccer and basketball, I find robotics more fun.  While on the robotics team I learn a lot and get to do a lot.  This year I’m looking forward to FTC championship matches.  I also like to travel and some of my favorite places are Spain, Italy, and the crystal clear blue waters of the Greek Islands.
