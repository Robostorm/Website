We are FTC team 12601 - Robostorm. Our team is made up of middle and high school students from Hunterdon County, New Jersey.

## Aidan
I am 17 years old and attend Delaware Valley Regional High School in Frenchtown, New Jersey. I joined FTC Team 12601 of Robostorm Robotics in 2019, mainly to work on programming and CAD design. I have taken on the lead programming role for the team. I also am on the drive team as the primary operator of the robot, controlling various mechanisms. In addition to those, interests of mine include electrical and civil engineering, chemistry, and mountain biking.

## Ismail
I am 16 years old and attend Delaware Valley Regional High School in Frenchtown, New Jersey. I have been in Robostorm Robotics club for 6 years and this is my 3rd year on FTC team 12601. This year I am the primary driver of the drive team, directing the robot, intake, and lift mechanisms. My skills vary and I help out with programming and lead the mechanical team.

## John
I am 14 years old and attend The Hunterdon County Computer Science and Applied Engineering Academy in Glen Gardner, New Jersey.  I have been in Robostorm Robotics for 5 years and this is my 3rd year on FTC team 12601.  This year I am the head of the CAD team and one of the drive team coaches. I have designed most of the custom parts and worked with other members to help them learn CAD.  I also work on both mechanical and programming for the robot.

## Vivian
I am 15 years old and attend Hunterdon Central Regional High School in Flemington, New Jersey. I have been in the robotics club for 4 years and this is my 3rd year on team 12601. I am in charge of the engineering notebook. I also have started to work on the CAD team, designing the team marker. In addition, I have been working on the team's social media presence. I have been rotating as one of the coaches for the drive team this season. This year I hope to have a neat and organized engineering notebook that will hopefully allow us to earn awards. I am also a member of HCRHS FRC Team 3637 Daleks where I work on the Chairman's Award committee and presentation team. 

## Zach
I am 15 years old and attend Hunterdon Central Regional High School in Flemington New Jersey.  I’ve been in robotics clubs for 6 years and this is my second year on the team.  While I like sports like soccer and basketball, I find robotics more fun.  While on the robotics team I learn a lot and get to do a lot.  This year I’m looking forward to FTC championship matches.  I am the human player on the drive team. I have been working on the mechanical team building several of the initial and prototype mechanisms that the robot uses. I also like to travel and some of my favorite places are Spain, Italy, and the crystal clear blue waters of the Greek Islands.
