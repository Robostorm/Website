We are FTC team 12601 - Robostorm. Our team is made up of middle and high school students from Hunterdon County, New Jersey.

## John
I am 15 years old and attend The Hunterdon County Computer Science and Applied Engineering Academy in Glen Gardner, New Jersey.  I have been in Robostorm Robotics for 7 years and this is my 6th year on FTC team 12601.  This year I am the head of the CAD team and one of the drive team coaches. I have designed most of the custom parts and worked with other members to help them learn CAD.  I also work on both mechanical and programming for the robot.

## Vivian
I am 16 years old and attend Hunterdon Central Regional High School in Flemington, New Jersey. I have been in the robotics club for 7 years and this is my 6th year on team 12601. I am in charge of the engineering notebook. I also have started to work on the CAD team, designing the team marker. In addition, I have been working on the team's social media presence. I have been rotating as one of the coaches for the drive team this season. This year I hope to have a neat and organized engineering notebook that will hopefully allow us to earn awards. I am also a member of HCRHS FRC Team 3637 Daleks where I work on the Chairman's Award committee, I am the safety captain and work on the presentation team. I also actively mentor several FLL teams.
