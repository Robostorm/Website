Robostorm has been involved in many smaller projects throughout the years.

## Arcade Machine
Because one year was going to be arcade themed, we had to make an arcade machine. We found some software to run on a [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org) called [PiMAME](http://piplay.org/)(Now called PiPlay) that would emulate many different arcade machines and games. We found an old CRT to use for a display and got some arcade buttons and a joystick. The arcade buttons and joystick got wired to a [Teensy++ 2.0](http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html) to emulate a USB keyboard plugged into the Pi. To finish off the arcade machine, we made a tabletop-sized wooden enclosure and painted it black. The arcade machine works great and had been very popular at the fair for many years. If you stop by during the fair in coming years, it is likely to be there.
